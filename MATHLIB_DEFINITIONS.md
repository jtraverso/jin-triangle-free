# Mathlib definitions used in Challenge.lean (Jin's theorem)

Verbatim excerpts of the Mathlib definitions used by the statements in `Challenge.lean`, at the
pinned Mathlib revision `c55e6e786f49471c72fbddbec5415808896aec1e` (tag `v4.35.0-rc3`, repository
https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4). Mathlib is released under the Apache-2.0

These excerpts are provided so that the meaning of every imported notion used by the
Challenge can be audited without fetching Mathlib.

## SimpleGraph

`Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Basic.lean`, line 95:

```lean
/-- A simple graph is an irreflexive symmetric relation `Adj` on a vertex type `V`.
The relation describes which pairs of vertices are adjacent.
There is exactly one edge for every pair of adjacent vertices;
see `SimpleGraph.edgeSet` for the corresponding edge set.

## SimpleGraph.IsNClique

## SimpleGraph.Coloring

`Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Coloring/Vertex.lean`, line 74:

```lean
/-- An `α`-coloring of a simple graph `G` is a homomorphism of `G` into the complete graph on `α`.
This is also known as a proper coloring.

## SimpleGraph.neighborFinset

`Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Finite.lean`, line 169:

```lean
/-- `G.neighborFinset v` is the `Finset` version of `G.neighborSet v` in case `G` is
locally finite at `v`. -/
